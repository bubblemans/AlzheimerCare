## Inspiration

The inspiration for this project came to us from recognizing that this simple at the first look app could have a great social cause, and there is nothing like that on the market. We wanted to create a tool for Alzheimer’s patients that would be a single platform for aggregates tools for their individual needs
We also wanted to get experience and play with different technologies. 

## What it does
Our app helps Alzheimer’s patients recognize people, associated memories, and manage reminders for daily activities using Augmented Reality and Machine Learning. Our reminder system helps users to keep track of their daily routines and medications.


## How we built it
Our iOS application uses Microsoft Azure’s Custom Vision to recognize family and friends. The app uses coreML, the ARKit, and the Vision framework to label the recognized people in real time. Using the Houndify API custom commands and the Oracle Cloud Database, the user can verbally request and receive information about people saved to their account. We also have a voice assistant utilizing Almond Voice API offered by Stanford to greet the user.


## Challenges we ran into
During the project, we ran into a few challenges -- starting with lack of documentations for some API’s and finishing with software failure (iPhone simulator)
We used several powerful  API’s, yet it was a challenge to implement them to our application due to the lack of good documentation. In addition, all of us were pioneers in using RESTful API’s.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We proud that out application has great social cause. We hope, it may help the patients to ease their daily life. We are proud that we were able to overcome implementing difficulties. 

## What we learned
We learned how to implement different API’s such as voice assistance and computer vision.

## What's next for memory lane
We need to provide users with the option of uploading images and improving accuracy of recognition.
